Welcome to my GitHub open-source repositories!

My interests include: the C++ Programming Language, algorithm engineering, programming language principles, protocol-oriented programming. 

Starting from 2024, my C++ programs will uniformly adopt snake_case. This is to maintain consistency with the STL library, enhance readability, and **improve aesthetics**.
